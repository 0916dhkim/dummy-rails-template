## API Routes

We need to implement 3 API routes in total.

1. A Route for uploading CSV
   - HTTP Method: <!-- GET, POST, etc. -->
   - Path: <!-- Example: /api/your/path -->
   - Request Type: <!-- Shape of request body -->
   - Response Type: <!-- Shape of response body -->
   - Description: <!-- 1 sentence summary of what this route does -->
2. A Route for starting the process of adding prospects to the database
   - HTTP Method: <!-- GET, POST, etc. -->
   - Path: <!-- Example: /api/your/path -->
   - Request Type: <!-- Shape of request body -->
   - Response Type: <!-- Shape of response body -->
   - Description: <!-- 1 sentence summary of what this route does -->
3. A Route for tracking the progress in database insertion
   - HTTP Method: <!-- GET, POST, etc. -->
   - Path: <!-- Example: /api/your/path -->
   - Request Type: <!-- Shape of request body -->
   - Response Type: <!-- Shape of response body -->
   - Description: <!-- 1 sentence summary of what this route does -->
